# ncloth_ui
An unfinished UI for Maya nCloth.

The goal was to make the important attributes easy to access and relevant settings obvious to notice.

I won't find the time to finish this, so by making this generally available maybe some code snippets can help others.

Disclaimer: Since this is an unfinished tool, the scripts are by no means well maintained(!) :)
