The renaming process happens in the following way:
(NDynamicsOutliner rename) -> 
Maya rename -> 
NDynamicsOutliner rename -> 
Playground rename

This way the Maya-rename is always reflected in the NDynamicsOutliner. The Playground only receiving name-changes puts him at the end of the chain (no possibility to rename nodes from the DockWidgets in the playground)

The attribute setting process happens in the following way:
(QWidget attr change) -> 
Maya attr change -> 
QWidget attr change

This way the Maya attr change always takes precedence and it's ensured that the UI doesn't provide bogus values. Once the Maya-attr is set that value is propagated to the UI.
